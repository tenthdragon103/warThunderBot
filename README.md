# Tenth's War Thunder Mod Bot
## Overview
This bot is to be ran on the host's computer, it uses War Thunders built-in data port `localhost:8111`
to get chats and display them on Discord. It uses chat to manage moderation and complaints from non-mod players.
Players can complain about other players and mods can issue warnings or bans. Mods also have a tool to view a player's
record. This is **NOT** a cheat and adheres to War Thunder's rules and TOS.
## Usage
Run the Jar file on the host's machine after initializing the game. The program does not need to be killed to restart
the game or to change maps. It will run in the background regardless of window focus or usage. As long as War Thunder
is outputting data to the port (game running and client connected to game server) it will attempt to mediate Discord
and War Thunder.
## Installation
Very easy; download the jar, run the jar.
(windows: double click, if you're on Linux I expect you to be smart enough to run a jar.)
